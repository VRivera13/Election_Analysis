 ## Election-Audit Summary
Reviewing the results provided based on just three counties, the script created can be modified to included additional counties.   The script can be modified by adding additional data regarding more counties to be able to incorporate into the code.  This would provide a broader range of should an election involve more than three counties.  The script can also be modified to provide results based on cities.   Adding a dictionary with the city names and count information would also provide more detailed info as to which cities within counties voted more/less for the candidates.
